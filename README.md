# Vera & Karel Had a Girl!
__And we made a game for her!__
https://baby.moricky.com/2024/

It started when we were expecting our first child, a son. I had an idea to announce his birth, and to reveal his name, using a video game. I am a video game developer after all. The result was a short and linear game made in Unity and published on web: https://baby.moricky.com/2021/

It was well received. I was pleased with it, but at the same time I knew I established a dangerous precedent. If we ever were to have a second child, I would have to create another game. No way one of the kids would have an announcement game and the other wouldn't. Could you imagine the lifelong blame I would have to suffer?

This is the game for the younger child, a daughter. While I made the first game in Unity, this time I chose pure HTML and JavaScript, so it can run on all platforms (the previous one was PC only, and I underestimated how many people don't regularly use PC). Of course, I knew nothing about JavaScript and my HTML knowledge was from my high school times, so I had to learn a lot. I aimed to write the code myself - no libraries, and certainly **no AI assistance**. In fact, I intentionally avoided using AI altogether. This is a personal game for my daughter, and it felt wrong to have a machine generate it or some of its parts for me. Besides, it's more fun to fiddle with the code itself and not with prompts.

I'm publishing source code of the project here. It's a free game anyway, and as a Bohemia Interactive developer, it feels natural to keep my code exposed, for everyone to see (and critique).

Have fun playing the game, and exploring how it was made! ðŸ’™
